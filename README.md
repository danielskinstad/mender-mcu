# mender-mcu

## Overview

mender-mcu is a fork of the [mender-mcu-client](https://github.com/joelguittet/mender-mcu-client)
project, created to extend its functionality and provide continued support from Northern.tech, the
creators of [Mender](https://mender.io/). This project is currently under construction, with the
primary goal of enhancing the original work while integrating it more closely with Northern.tech's
suite of products.


## Project Status

This repository is a work in progress. As we continue development, features and functionality may
evolve significantly. We are actively working on expanding the capabilities of the original
mender-mcu-client to better support a wider range of use cases.


## Why Fork?

The decision to fork the original mender-mcu-client was made to:

* **Extend Functionality**: Introduce new features and enhancements that align with the broader
  Mender ecosystem.
* **Provide Official Support**: Ensure that the project receives the necessary attention and
  resources from Northern.tech to meet the needs of the community and enterprise users.


## Getting Started
